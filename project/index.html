          <h3>Quinoa Tabouli Salad</h3>
          <p>Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad is a vibrant and nutritious twist on the traditional Middle Eastern dish.

The salad features a refreshing blend of finely chopped parsley and mint, diced tomatoes and cucumbers, and a zesty lemon-olive oil dressing. It's a light, herbaceous dish that's perfect as a side or a standalone meal, ideal for warm days and meal prep.</p>
